      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        My name is Stefin Racho, a 20-year-old aspiring Software Engineer and
        Web Developer from Merced, California. I'm currently attending the
        University of California, Merced, pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in
        Computer Science and Engineering. My academic journey began at Merced
        College, where I studied Computer Science right after graduating Merced
        High School in 2020.

      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        As a first-generation college student, I've had to navigate the academic
        world largely on my own. This journey, while challenging, has taught me
        the value of self-sufficiency and resilience. I've learned to embrace
        challenges as opportunities for growth and to rely on my own abilities
        to overcome obstacles.
      </p>
      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        I'm proud of my Native American and Mexican heritage. Outside of my
        academic pursuits, I enjoy weight lifting, long-distance running,
        skateboarding, and immersing myself in technology, including computers
        and video games.
      </p>
      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        One of my most significant experiences was serving as Secretary for the
        Computer Science Club at Merced College. In this role, I helped organize
        the Merced College Science Fair, which was a rewarding experience that
        allowed me to contribute to my community while honing my organizational
        skills.
      </p>
      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        My short-term goal is to graduate from the University of California,
        Merced, and earn my Bachelor's degree. In the long term, I aspire to
        become a software engineer in the tech industry and start my own family.
        I'm driven by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and have a
        passion for being at the forefront of this exciting field.
      </p>
      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        I believe in lifelong learning and strive to learn something new every
        day. I find joy and satisfaction in expanding my knowledge, especially
        when it comes to technology-related projects like building websites or
        apps.
      </p>
      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        Growing up, I witnessed my family struggle financially. This experience
        has shaped my career path and instilled in me a strong drive to succeed.
        I've learned to be grateful for what I have and to relentlessly pursue
        my goals. I'm excited about the future and look forward to the
        opportunities that lie ahead in my journey to becoming a software
        engineer.
