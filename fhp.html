        Project was an innovative solution developed during a 48-hour hackathon,
        aimed at predicting and preventing floods. Despite the team's lack of
        machine learning expertise, Stefin and his group of three devised a
        unique approach to the problem. They used a custom algorithm, written in
        Java, to analyze the provided data. To make the solution more
        user-friendly, Stefin developed an interactive interface using the
        Google Maps API. This allowed users to click on an area and receive a
        prediction of the likelihood of a flood occurring in that location. The
        project demonstrated Stefin's ability to think creatively and adapt to
        challenges, resulting in a commendable 4th place finish at the SWF
        Hackathon.

      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        The project was built through a combination of innovative thinking and
        technical skills. Given the challenge of predicting floods without the
        use of machine learning, Stefin and his team devised a unique approach.
        They developed a custom algorithm in Java to analyze the provided data.
        Stefin was primarily responsible for creating an interactive interface
        for the solution. He used the Google Maps API to develop a component
        that allowed users to click on an area and receive a prediction of the
        likelihood of a flood. This user-friendly interface was designed to make
        the complex data analysis more accessible and understandable to users.
        Despite the time pressure of the hackathon, Stefin and his team
        successfully built and submitted their project.

      <h2 class="title t2 left">What was the result?</h2>
      <p class="p-info mb-2">
        The result of Stefin's First Hackathon was a testament to the team's
        innovative thinking and problem-solving skills. Despite being newcomers
        to the field and not having machine learning expertise, Stefin and his
        team managed to secure a commendable 4th place at the SWF Hackathon.
        Their unique approach to flood prediction, which combined a custom Java
        algorithm with an interactive Google Maps interface, was recognized for
        its creativity and user-centric design. The project, while not fully
        functional in its predictive capabilities, demonstrated the team's
        commitment to tackling complex problems and their ability to deliver
        under pressure. This experience served as a significant milestone in
        Stefin's journey, reinforcing his problem-solving skills and
        adaptability.
