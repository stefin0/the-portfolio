        is a website that was collaboratively developed by Stefin and his team
        to promote and organize the Merced College Science Fair. Built using
        React.js, the website serves as a central hub for all information
        related to the Science Fair. It was designed with a clear purpose, a
        user-friendly interface, and an appealing aesthetic, all of which were
        determined through detailed discussions within the team prior to
        development. The website played a significant role in the successful
        organization and promotion of the Science Fair, which saw its highest
        attendance since the lockdown, marking a significant achievement for
        Stefin and his team.
